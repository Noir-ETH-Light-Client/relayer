# RELAYER

## Run Code

```
npm i
```

You need to create an .env file with the same content as in the .env.example file. That is the contract address that we have deployed on the Goerli network, so you need a corresponding provider. If you deploy on another network, you can customize it again. Once completed, run the server as follows: 

```
npm run start:dev
```
